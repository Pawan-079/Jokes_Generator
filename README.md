## **Joke Generator** ðŸ¤£

Click to generate Jokes continuously

A fun and simple web app that generates random jokes at the click of a button. The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and retrieves jokes from an external joke API. Each time the user clicks the button, a new joke is displayed with a colorful, playful "laughing" text effect to make the experience even more enjoyable!

## **Features**
- **Random Joke Generation**: Fetches jokes from a joke API each time the button is clicked.
- **Laughing Text Effect**: The joke text is animated with vibrant colors, giving it a lively, "laughing" appearance.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is simple and responsive, suitable for both desktop and mobile use.

## **How It Works**
1. **User Interaction**: The user clicks the "Generate Joke" button.
2. **API Request**: A JavaScript `fetch` request retrieves a random joke from the [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke).
3. **Dynamic Joke Display**: The joke is dynamically inserted into the page, with the text animated to change colors continuously.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page, including the vibrant text animation.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To handle the API requests and update the page dynamically.

## **Installation & Setup**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pawan-079/jokes-Generator.git
